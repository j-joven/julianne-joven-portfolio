        <div class="bio-text">
          <p>Currently, I am pursuing a BFA in graphic design at George Mason University. 
            Throughout my time studying at George Mason, I have been able to acquire and 
            cultivate skills within Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. 
            Additionally, I have created promotional graphics for the Filipino Cultural 
            Association (FCA) and KDC Mythic, increasing visibility for both college 
            organizations as well as support and turnout for their events and projects. 
            As I continue to grow as a designer, I aim to develop a more versatile skill 
            set and collaborate with more clients and experienced designers to further 
            establish my brand and expertise.</p>

          <p>I did not start out as a digital artist, though—in fact, my work was exclusively 
            traditional growing up, as mediums such as oil pastel, graphite, and especially 
            colored pencils were more accessible to me at the time. But as time went on, and 
            the more I was exposed to grunge, 2000s design, and especially mixed media design, 
            the more my work shifted into the digital space. What remains the same, however, is 
            the high expectations I hold upon myself and my work, driving my passion to pursue 
            excellence and ensure quality designs that my clients and myself are proud to 
            showcase. My creative process invests meticulous care and effort into each project, 
            which I hope to highlight in my designs as well.</p>

          <p>Outside of design, I enjoy creating and expressing myself through other forms of 
            art—specifically dance, where I’m either choreographing for performances or 
            taking part in some myself. Though not as frequently, I also enjoy capturing the 
            little, easily missable moments that I want to immortalize through photography, and 
            aim to further develop my skills in this field to use in my practice.</p>
